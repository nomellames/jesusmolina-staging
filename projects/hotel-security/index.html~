						The St. Regis ShenZhen, a gorgeous luxury hotel occupying the top 28 floors of a 100 story skyscraper, offers guests a unique feature: a room remote control in the form of an iPad2. The iPad2 controls the lighting, temperature, music, do not disturb light, TV, even the blinds and other miscellaneous room actions. However, the deployment of the home automation protocol contained several fatal flaws that allowed an arbitrary attacker to control virtually every appliance in the hotel remotely. I discovered these flaws and, as a result, was able to create the ultimate remote control. The attacker does not even need to be in the hotel - he could be in another country. </div>
