Thank you very much to all of you that attended my talks at [BlackHat](https://www.blackhat.com/us-14/briefings.html#learn-how-to-control-every-room-at-a-luxury-hotel-remotely-the-dangers-of-insecure-home-automation-deployment) and [Defcon](https://www.defcon.org/html/defcon-22/dc-22-speakers.html). If you are interested in the supporting materials of the talk, I am providing a local mirror for download:

- [White Paper](http://www.jesusmolina.com/publications/2014-Jesus-Molina-Learn-how-to-control-every-room.pdf)
- [Slides](http://www.jesusmolina.com/publications/2014-slides-how-to-control-every-room.pdf)

I will publish the code in a couple of weeks (decode KNX payloads and address and send KNX/IP)

###Hotel Response###
**I want to thank the Starwood group for their support for the talk**. As discussed in the NPR article [To Hack or Not to Hack](http://www.npr.org/blogs/alltechconsidered/2014/08/08/338776873/when-hackers-test-for-flaws-they-might-earn-cash-or-threats) sometimes the actions of the affected parties after an intrusion is either timid or downright aggressive against the security researchers involved. Their reaction should serve as a template for other companies.  Security researchers are here to serve the community and help to prevent real problems in the future, and the Hotel and their leadership demonstrated that their guests are the top priority and opened dialogue to find a solution. Notice the sharp contrast to the indifferent response by the KNX association.
